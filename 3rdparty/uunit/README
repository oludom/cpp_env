µUnit (micro-unit) is a minimalistic, header only, unit-test framework for C++.

For an example of how to use it with a simple Makefile project see the examples
folder.

It outputs CppUnit compatible xml and can be used with for example the xUnit
plugin for jenkins.

µUnit was originally developed by Bent Bisballe Nyeng for the DrumGizmo project
under the name dgUnit but has since then changed name and moved into its own
project for easier re-use in other C++ projects.

µUnit is released under the CC0-1.0 license. See the CC0-1.0 file for further
details.
